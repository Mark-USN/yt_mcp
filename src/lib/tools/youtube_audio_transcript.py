# Goal: allow MCP long-jobs to be cancelled while transcribing.
# Strategy:
#   * keep the MCP tool function async
#   * yield to the event loop between chunks (await sleep(0))
#   * do the heavy Whisper work in a dedicated single worker thread so the loop
#     stays responsive and cancellation can be observed between chunks.
#
# IMPORTANT LIMITATION:
#   Cancellation is *cooperative* and takes effect BETWEEN chunks.
#   If a single chunk transcription takes a long time, cancellation will be
#   delayed until that chunk completes. To improve responsiveness, use a smaller
#   chunk_duration (e.g., 10-15s).
